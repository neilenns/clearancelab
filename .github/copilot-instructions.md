# Project coding standards

## NextJS

- Use shadcn for all UI components
- Include appropriate aria attributes for accessibility
- Prefer htmlFor and aria-labelledby over aria-label
- Don't include aria attributes on FormField children, they are handled automatically by shadcn
- Reference shadcn components using @/components/ui
- Use Switch instead of Checkbox for boolean values
- All titles and headings are in sentence case
