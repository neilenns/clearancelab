# Packages for the monorepo

The method for building packages and managing shared configs is primarily based on the [mono-ts example](https://github.com/0x80/mono-ts). Typescript configs are based on the [typescript-config](https://github.com/0x80/typescript-config) example.

A summary is available in the [companion blog post](https://thijs-koerselman.medium.com/my-quest-for-the-perfect-ts-monorepo-62653d3047eb).
